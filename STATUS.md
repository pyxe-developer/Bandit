# Current Context

## Last Updated: 2026-06-05

## Current Work Item: BANDIT-059

## Current Status

Bandit is in Phase 8 - Workflow Cockpit kickoff / Harness-Agnostic CLI Trust
Layer Pivot.

`BANDIT-059` is active. Repo PM created the Trust Verify Snapshot Foundation
work item from `docs/specs/BANDIT-GAP-TRUST-VERIFY-SNAPSHOT-FOUNDATION.json`
and linked `BANDIT-GAP-TRUST-VERIFY-SNAPSHOT-FOUNDATION` as the active
bootstrap chore.

`BANDIT-058` is closed. It delivered the Role Contracts And Run Manifests slice
under `BANDIT-GAP-ROLE-SCOPED-WORKFLOW-ORCHESTRATION`, including role contract
policy evidence, role-run manifest evidence, CLI validation, fail-closed
authority and path-containment checks, focused tests, Stage 4 review evidence,
Stage 5 landing evidence, local-record landing action, and Stage 6
retrospective/improvement/gap disposition.

The Pi/Aperture harness-specific path is superseded by
`docs/decisions/2026-06-05-harness-agnostic-cli-trust-layer.md`.

Current stage: Stage 1 formation review passed / coordination transition
pending.

Latest Qwen retry: 2026-06-05T20:44:57Z; passed with zero findings after Local
Qwen provider availability was restored.

Next action: Record the CLI-owned `formation_approved` coordination transition
for `BANDIT-059` before Stage 2 RED evidence.

No operator-owned input is required for the Qwen retry/repair. Do not start RED
evidence, implementation, Trust Verifier cutover, a new work item, or
Pi/Aperture agent-scope work until `BANDIT-059` records formation approval.

`BANDIT-GAP-ARTIFACT-INPUT-DIRECTORY-SPLIT` is queued as a cleanup candidate to
separate artifact-renderer JSON inputs and reviewer captures from work/gap specs
in `docs/specs/`. Promote it before Trust Verify Snapshot Foundation only if
artifact-input path clarity blocks the verifier/report contract.
