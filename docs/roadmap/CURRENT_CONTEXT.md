# Current Context

## Status

**Phase:** 5 - UAT And Auto-Landing.

**State:** `BANDIT-016` landed as the bootstrap-gap chore for
`BANDIT-GAP-STAGE4-EVIDENCE-HEAD-SEMANTICS`. Its landing verdict, local-record
landing action, retrospective, and gap-ledger disposition are recorded in
`docs/work/BANDIT-016/`. The operator ended the repeated Local Qwen
future-hardening loop, directed Codex PM to land `BANDIT-016` now, and required
the remaining Local Qwen findings to become the next chore.

`BANDIT-017` resolved `BANDIT-GAP-LANDING-GATE-COMPLEXITY-HARDENING`. Its
brief, RED evidence, implementation evidence, review evidence, landing verdict,
local-record landing action, retrospective, and gap-ledger disposition are
recorded in `docs/work/BANDIT-017/` and `.bandit/bootstrap-gaps.json`.

`BANDIT-018` is active as the bootstrap-gap chore for
`BANDIT-GAP-LIVE-ESCALATED-REVIEWER`. Its brief is recorded in
`docs/work/BANDIT-018/brief.md`, RED evidence is recorded in
`docs/work/BANDIT-018/red-evidence.md`, implementation evidence is recorded in
`docs/work/BANDIT-018/implementation-evidence.md`, and
`.bandit/bootstrap-gaps.json` links the gap to `BANDIT-018` as an active chore.
Do not begin work-item creation, artifact creation, heartbeat, cockpit, Phase 6
Coordination Primitive, Phase 7 Improvement Engine, Phase 8 Workflow Cockpit,
Phase 9 dogfood, or feature work until `BANDIT-018` is landed, blocked on
operator-owned input, or explicitly dispositioned.

**Last completed milestone:** `BANDIT-017` resolved landing-gate complexity and
git diagnostics hardening for the Stage 4 review path.

**Current next action:** Record `BANDIT-018` review and cross-model evidence for
the implementation head.

## Active Work

**Active work item:** `BANDIT-018` - Live Escalated Reviewer Routing.

**Completed work items:** `BANDIT-001` - Repo-Native State And CLI Skeleton;

Complexity And Git Diagnostics Hardening.

**Expected next deliverable:** Review evidence for `BANDIT-018`.

## Known Bootstrap Gaps

These are expected because Bandit does not exist yet:

- No Bandit work-item creation command.
- Bootstrap-gap tracking artifact, listing command, and validation path are
  implemented and landed in `BANDIT-011`.
- CodeRabbit state capture substrate exists, but live CodeRabbit API, GitHub
  API, PR comment polling, repair orchestration, and rerun automation remain
  unavailable.
- Local Qwen gate substrate exists, and `BANDIT-009` repaired full-packet
  reliability by routing through direct local oMLX while preserving structured
  findings.
- Escalated adversarial review placeholder gate exists; live escalated reviewer
  routing remains unavailable.
- Landing Agent gap is resolved by `BANDIT-014`; a durable local-record Landing
  Agent contract, command, review evidence, landing verdict, landing action
  evidence, retrospective, and gap-ledger disposition exist.
- No general artifact creation command outside explicit PRD draft-work.
- CLI-owned UAT approval artifacts and stale-UAT detection are implemented and
  landed in `BANDIT-012`.
- No heartbeat chore-agent.
- No cockpit.

Bootstrap work must record these gaps honestly instead of pretending final
gates ran. Open bootstrap gaps are the current work queue; do not start
Phase 6 Coordination Primitive, Phase 7 Improvement Engine, Phase 8 Workflow
Cockpit, Phase 9 dogfood, feature, or cockpit work while any open gap remains
queued or active. `BANDIT-GAP-STAGE4-EVIDENCE-HEAD-SEMANTICS` is resolved by
`BANDIT-016`. `BANDIT-GAP-LANDING-GATE-COMPLEXITY-HARDENING` is resolved by
`BANDIT-017`. `BANDIT-GAP-LIVE-ESCALATED-REVIEWER` is active as
`BANDIT-018`; implementation evidence is recorded and the current step is
review and cross-model evidence. `BANDIT-GAP-LIVE-CODERABBIT` is resolved by
`BANDIT-015`;
implementation evidence, CodeRabbit evidence, review evidence, and local Qwen
evidence are recorded. The local Qwen finding repair is recorded in
`docs/work/BANDIT-015/qwen-finding-repair.md`; CodeRabbit and aggregate review
evidence are refreshed at the repair head. The prior local Qwen rerun findings
are dispositioned in `docs/work/BANDIT-015/qwen-rerun-disposition.md`. The
current local Qwen rerun at PM disposition head
`068c4482ba156a158abd92faba2fcee2841f2288` returned a `blocker` verdict; its
findings are triaged in
`docs/work/BANDIT-015/qwen-blocker-disposition.md`. The Local Qwen rerun at
blocker-disposition head `4569c8f92eacf7df098f7f370bd8ac1c09d82b96` returned
another `blocker` verdict; its findings are triaged in
`docs/work/BANDIT-015/qwen-latest-blocker-disposition.md`. The remaining
blocker was the missing `docs/work/BANDIT-015/escalated-review.md` artifact,
which is now recorded. Local Qwen rerun at escalated-review disposition head
`16e7ecac0f2d590f9413c8f30d8ed3f554ceb91a` returned a new `blocker` verdict;
Codex PM triaged that blocker in
`docs/work/BANDIT-015/qwen-evidence-head-disposition.md` and refreshed
CodeRabbit evidence at source head
`c584fe3b06692632723aedad2f1f9d69db607602`. Local Qwen rerun at
evidence-head-disposition head `9248f34b104bc45eed91fb752a49eb0de987e470`
returned another `blocker` verdict. The operator ended that recursive loop,
authorized landing, and required the issue to be queued as
`BANDIT-GAP-STAGE4-EVIDENCE-HEAD-SEMANTICS`. `BANDIT-015` has landing action
evidence and retrospective closeout.

## Context Guardrails

- In a cold session, invoke `$bandit` or type `/bandit` to restore context from repo artifacts.
- `CONTEXT.md` is a required first-read file for cold sessions.
- Before each slice, read `CLEAN_CODE.md`.
- Before writing code, create or update the current work item brief.
- If required operator-owned input is missing, call it out directly and halt the blocked action.
- Before landing any slice, record whether it complies with `CLEAN_CODE.md` and `docs/verification/STAGE_RUBRICS.md`.
- After each completed step, update this file if the next action changed.
- If the Bandit skill or operating vocabulary changes, update `CONTEXT.md` in the same turn.
- If Codex cannot answer "what is next?" from this file and `ROADMAP.md`, stop and repair context.
- The operator should not need to reconstruct status from chat.

## Next Step Details

Phase 5 UAT and auto-landing boundary.

BANDIT-005 started Phase 4 by adding pre-landing review evidence, landing
verdict contracts, source-drift checks, validation, and
`bandit land-check <work-item-id>`. BANDIT-006 added the local Qwen baseline
reviewer profile/evidence/command substrate. BANDIT-007 added the CodeRabbit
review evidence template/parser/command substrate and `land-check` integration,
while recording live CodeRabbit polling as a bootstrap gap. BANDIT-008 repaired
the local Qwen baseline reviewer runtime route away from Qwen Code/Ollama
drift. BANDIT-009 repaired full-packet local Qwen reliability and proved the
baseline can return structured output for real Bandit packets. BANDIT-010 added
the escalated adversarial reviewer placeholder gate and completed the Phase 4
placeholder set.

`BANDIT-011` landed the bootstrap-gap ledger, validation path, and list command.
Future cold starts should use `bandit gaps list` and `bandit validate` when
checking whether bootstrap gaps are active, queued, resolved, or blocked.

`BANDIT-012` completed the first Phase 5 capability: CLI-owned UAT approval
artifacts and stale-UAT detection.

`BANDIT-013` implemented, reviewed, marked safe-to-land, and landed the
auto-landing eligibility policy. Verification passed with `npm test`, `npm run
typecheck`, `npm run bandit -- validate`, `npm run bandit -- land-check
BANDIT-013`, `npm run bandit -- auto-land-check BANDIT-013`, `npm run bandit
-- gaps list`, and `git diff --check`.

`BANDIT-014` implemented, reviewed, marked safe-to-land, locally recorded its
Landing Agent landing action, and closed out the Landing Agent bootstrap gap.
Verification passed with `node --test test/landing-gates.test.mjs`, `npm test`,
`npm run typecheck`, `npm run bandit -- validate`, `npm run bandit -- land-check
BANDIT-014`, `npm run bandit -- auto-land-check BANDIT-014`, `npm run bandit
-- gaps list`, and `git diff --check`.

Use `bandit gaps list` as the routing source and complete exactly one
bootstrap-gap chore at a time. Current priority is:

1. `BANDIT-GAP-LIVE-ESCALATED-REVIEWER` as active `BANDIT-018`.
2. `BANDIT-GAP-WORK-ITEM-CREATE-COMMAND`.
3. `BANDIT-GAP-GENERAL-ARTIFACT-CREATE-COMMAND`.
4. `BANDIT-GAP-HEARTBEAT-CHORE-AGENT`.
5. `BANDIT-GAP-WORKFLOW-COCKPIT`.

Create exactly one next gap chore at a time. RED evidence for `BANDIT-018` is
recorded in `docs/work/BANDIT-018/red-evidence.md`; implementation evidence is
recorded in `docs/work/BANDIT-018/implementation-evidence.md`. The current step
is only to record review and cross-model evidence for `BANDIT-018`. Do not
begin later gaps or unrelated feature work.

## Required Operator Input

None recorded for the next review-evidence step. Repo artifacts define
`BANDIT-018` live escalated-reviewer routing as the active chore and review
evidence as the next action.

Actual product UAT approval for future feature slices remains operator-owned
and must not be inferred by Codex PM or implementation agents.
